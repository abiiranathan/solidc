/**
 * @file thread.h
 * @brief Cross-platform thread management and system information utilities.
 *
 * Provides a unified interface for thread creation, synchronization, and system
 * information queries across Windows and POSIX systems. All thread functions
 * return 0 on success and non-zero on error for consistency with POSIX conventions.
 *
 * Thread safety is documented per function. Generally, thread creation and
 * attribute management functions are thread-safe, but individual thread
 * attribute objects should not be modified concurrently.
 *
 * @note This library requires linking with pthread on POSIX systems (-lpthread).
 *
 * @section limitations Platform Limitations
 *
 * **Windows Return Value Limitation:**
 * On Windows, thread return values (void*) are stored as 32-bit DWORD values.
 * If your thread returns a 64-bit pointer on 64-bit Windows, the upper 32 bits
 * will be lost. For portable code, return values should fit in 32 bits
 * (e.g., cast integer status codes to void*).
 *
 * **Thread ID Portability:**
 * The get_tid() function returns unsigned long, but pthread_t is an opaque type
 * that may not be convertible to an integer on all platforms. Use get_tid()
 * for logging/debugging only, not as a unique identifier for synchronization.
 *
 * **Thread Handle Lifetime:**
 * After calling thread_detach() on Windows, the thread handle becomes invalid
 * and must not be used for any subsequent operations. This matches POSIX semantics
 * where detached threads cannot be joined.
