/**
 * @file threadpool.h
 * @brief Work-stealing thread pool for concurrent task execution.
 *
 * @details
 * This thread pool uses the Chase-Lev (2005) work-stealing deque algorithm
 * with the Le et al. (2013) correction for the last-item ABA hazard.
 *
 * ## Architecture
 *
 * Each worker thread owns a private double-ended queue (deque):
 * - The **owner** pushes and pops tasks at the **bottom** end using a single
 *   release store — no CAS, no lock, no contention with other threads.
 * - **Thieves** (idle workers) steal one task at a time from the **top** end
 *   using a single seq_cst CAS.
 *
 * External submitters (threads that are not pool workers) push tasks into a
 * shared @c GlobalQueue protected by a mutex.  Workers drain this queue in
 * batches of @c BATCH_SIZE tasks per mutex acquisition, then distribute the
 * extras into their own private deques for subsequent lock-free consumption.
 *
 * ```
 *   External submitter
 *        │
 *        ▼
 *   [ GlobalQueue ]  ──batch drain──▶  worker[0] deque  ◀── steal ── worker[1]
 *                                      worker[1] deque  ◀── steal ── worker[2]
 *                                      ...
 * ```
 *
 * ## Threading model
 *
 * | Operation                 | Cost                                        |
 * |---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
 * | Worker push/pop (own deque) | One release store — zero contention      |
 * | Thief steal               | One seq_cst CAS — contended only between thieves |
 * | External submit (single)  | One mutex round-trip per task              |
 * | External submit (batch)   | One mutex round-trip per @c GLOBAL_Q_SIZE tasks |
 * | Worker drain from global  | One mutex round-trip per @c BATCH_SIZE tasks |
 *
 * ## Compile-time knobs
 *
 *
 * Internal constants (defined in threadpool.c, not overridable from the header):
 *
 * | Constant         | Value  | Meaning                                    |
 * |------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|
 * | @c DEQUE_SIZE    | 4096   | Slots per private Chase-Lev deque          |
 * | @c GLOBAL_Q_SIZE | 16384  | Slots in the shared external submission queue |
 * | @c BATCH_SIZE    | 64     | Tasks pulled from the global queue per mutex acquisition |
 * | @c YIELD_THRESHOLD | 8    | Spin rounds before a worker parks on a condvar |
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * ```c
 * Threadpool* pool = threadpool_create(8);
 *
 * // Single-task submission
 * threadpool_submit(pool, my_fn, my_arg);
 *
 * // Batch submission (preferred for large workloads)
 * void (*fns[N])(void*) = { ... };
 * void*  args[N]        = { ... };
 * threadpool_submit_batch(pool, fns, args, N);
 *
 * // Wait for all current tasks to complete (pool remains usable)
 * threadpool_wait(pool);
 *
 * // Tear down
 * threadpool_destroy(pool, -1);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 *
 * All public functions are safe to call from any thread concurrently, including
 * from within a running task.  A task may call @c threadpool_submit or
 * @c threadpool_submit_batch to enqueue follow-on work; in that case the task
 * is treated as a worker thread and pushes directly into its own private deque
 * at zero contention cost.

/**
 * @brief Submit multiple tasks to the pool in a single call.
 *
 * Reduces mutex acquisition overhead from O(@p count) to
 * O(@p count / @c GLOBAL_Q_SIZE) compared to calling @c threadpool_submit
 * in a loop.  For a batch of 10 000 tasks with @c GLOBAL_Q_SIZE = 16384,
 * this is a single mutex acquisition instead of 10 000.
 *
 * ### Submission paths
 *
 * **Worker thread**: iterates @p functions and pushes each task into the
 * caller's own deque with @c deque_push_bottom (lock-free).  Any tasks that
 * do not fit in the private deque (overflow past 4096 slots) are forwarded to
 * the global queue via @c gq_push_batch.
 *
 * **External thread**: builds a flat @c Task array on the stack (if
 * @p count ≤ @c BATCH_SIZE) or heap, then hands it to @c gq_push_batch which
 * holds @c gq_mutex for the duration of each chunk write.  If the global queue
 * fills up mid-batch, @c gq_push_batch waits on @c not_full and resumes from
 * where it left off — the caller blocks until all @p count tasks are enqueued
 * or the pool shuts down.
 *
 * @param pool      Pool to submit to.  Must not be @c NULL.
 * @param functions Array of @p count function pointers.  @c NULL entries are
 *                  silently skipped and do not count toward the return value.
 * @param args      Array of @p count argument pointers, or @c NULL to pass
 *                  @c NULL as the argument to every task.
 * @param count     Number of entries in @p functions (and @p args if non-NULL).
 *
 * @return Number of tasks successfully enqueued.  Equal to the number of
 *         non-NULL entries in @p functions under normal operation.  May be
 *         less than @p count if the pool begins shutting down mid-batch; the
 *         caller should treat a short return as a fatal error.
 *         Returns 0 if @p pool is @c NULL, @p functions is @c NULL, or
 *         @p count is 0.
 *
 * @par Example
 * @code
 * #define N 10000
 * void (*fns[N])(void*);
 * void*  args_arr[N];
 * for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { fns[i] = process; args_arr[i] = &items[i]; }
 *
 * size_t submitted = threadpool_submit_batch(pool, fns, args_arr, N);
 * assert(submitted == N);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par Complexity
 * O(@p count / @c GLOBAL_Q_SIZE) mutex acquisitions for external threads;
 * O(@p count) deque stores (lock-free) for worker threads.

 *
 * Returns only when both conditions hold simultaneously:
 * 1. Every worker's private deque is empty.
 * 2. The global submission queue is empty.
 * 3. No worker is currently executing a task (@c num_active == 0).
 *
 * Condition 3 ensures correctness when a task itself calls
 * @c threadpool_submit or @c threadpool_submit_batch — the pool is not
 * considered idle until those follow-on tasks have also completed.
 *
 * The pool remains fully operational after @c threadpool_wait returns.
 * New tasks may be submitted immediately.
 *
 * @param pool Pool to wait on.  If @c NULL the function returns immediately.
 *
 * @note Do **not** call @c threadpool_wait from within a running task.
 *       The task holds a slot in @c num_active, so the wait condition can
 *       never be satisfied while that task is still on the call stack —
 *       this will deadlock.
 *
 * @par Typical usage
 * @code
 * // Phase 1
 * threadpool_submit_batch(pool, fns1, args1, N1);
 * threadpool_wait(pool);
 * process_phase1_results();
 *
 * // Phase 2 — pool is still alive and ready

 * threadpool_destroy(pool, -1);

 * 2. Sets the @c shutdown flag atomically while still holding @c idle_lock,

 *    store and the subsequent broadcast.
 * 3. Broadcasts on @c work_available to wake every parked worker.
