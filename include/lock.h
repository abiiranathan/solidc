/**
 * @file lock.h
 * @brief Cross-platform mutex and condition variable wrapper.
 *
 * Provides a unified interface for synchronization primitives across
 * Windows (Critical Sections/Condition Variables) and POSIX systems
 * (pthread mutexes/condition variables).
 *
 * All functions return integer error codes instead of terminating the program,
 * allowing for proper error handling and recovery.
 *
 * @note This library is thread-safe where documented, but initialization
 *       and destruction functions are NOT thread-safe.
